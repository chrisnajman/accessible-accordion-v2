                        <p>This is arguably the most fundamental question in philosophy. I once heard a respected
                            philosopher say it was the <q>wrong question</q>, without proffering a <q>right
                                question</q>. I
                            thought
                            this was a cop-out, not to mention a not-so-subtle evasion. But there are two major aspects
                            to
                            this question, and most attempted answers only address one.</p>
                        <p>We inhabit a universe we believe to be around fourteen billion years old. Proto-human
                            consciousness only came into being about six million years ago, with <i>Homo sapiens</i>
                            arriving on the scene only very recently - roughly 200,000 years ago. But here's the thing:
                            without a conscious entity to perceive the Universe, there might as well be nothing.</p>
                        <p>Einstein famously said, <q>The most incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it's
                                comprehensible.</q> Many scientists, if not most, believe that the Universe and our
                            status
                            within
                            it is a freak accident. Paul Davies in his erudite book <i>The Goldilocks Enigma</i> calls
                            this interpretation <q>the absurd universe</q>. Their standard current answer to this enigma
                            is
                            that
                            there are many, perhaps an infinite number of universes. If this is the case, then there are
                            an
                            infinite number of you and me. The multiverse hypothesis says that all possibilities are
                            equally
                            valid, which doesn't explain anything, except to say that the freak accident of our
                            existence
                            can only be understood within an endless sea of all possible existences. A number of
                            physicists
                            and cosmologists have further pointed out that there are constants pertaining to fundamental
                            physical laws whose size permits complex life-forms to evolve. Even small variances in these
                            numbers, up or down, could have made the Universe lifeless. And as the cosmologist John
                            Barrow
                            has pointed out, the Universe also needs to be of the mind-boggling scale we observe to
                            allow
                            time for complex life - meaning us - to evolve. Brandon Carter coined and defined two
                            anthropic
                            principles on the basis of these ideas. The <i>weak anthropic principle</i> says that only a
                            universe that contains observers can be observed (which is a tautology). The <i>strong
                                anthropic principle</i> says that only a universe that permits observers to emerge can
                            <i>exist</i>. To be self-realised, a universe requires consciousness, otherwise it's
                            effectively non-existent; in the same way that a lost manuscript by Shakespeare would be
                            non-existent.

                        <p>Anne Boleyn, Queen Consort of England, was executed by a French swordsman at the Tower of
                            London
                            on 19th May 1536, just sixteen months after becoming Henry VII's second wife.</p>

                        <p>So, how did this 35 year-old, spirited young woman fall so dramatically from favour? She had
                            after all caught Henry's eye in the mid 1520s and moved successfully from mistress (although
                            not
                            in the full sense of the word) to queen. Henry VIII had been so besotted with her that he
                            had
                            waited for seven years for her and bombarded her with letters when she was removed from
                            court,
                            seventeen of which remain today, and yet this was a man who hated writing his own letters.
                            He
                            broke with Rome to have her, he fell out with men who had been his best friends and
                            advisers, he
                            had moved heaven and earth to possess Anne - how can such love and passion turn into a dark
                            hatred which resulted in Henry ordering Anne to be executed?</p>

                        <p>If you google "Why was Anne Boleyn executed?" or ask people, you'll get all kinds of
                            answers:-
                        </p>

                        <ul class="flow">
                            <li>She committed treason, adultery and incest</li>

                            <li>She had hinted at Henry VIII's impotency and ridiculed him</li>
                            <li>Her sharp tongue had made her many enemies who trumped up the charges</li>

                        <p>This was a magical revelation for the Greeks and the Egyptians, who were able to see from the
                            motions of the stars and the way the Sun moved. They saw the way the Sun's shadow worked in
                            different places. And they figured, well, that's only possible if the Earth is round. And
                            they took that information and it extended into the time of the great mariners that explored
                            our Earth by ships.</p>
                        <p>They made the first orbit of Earth by sea, and they knew the Earth was round, allowing them
                            to go across one ocean and come back home the other way. If the Earth were flat, they would
                            have sailed off the end. And so we knew that.</p>
                        <p>But then, at the dawn of the space age, in the late 50s and 60s, we were able to see for
                            ourselves that our beautiful home is a gorgeous round object known as a sphere. And that was
                            really special. It put ourselves into context of our solar system and our universe.</p>
                        <p>We have a big round Sun and a beautiful round Earth and a round Mars.</p>
                        <p>And today we use the roundness of Earth, the spherical Earth, to use methods in space geodesy
                            to figure out where we are, where we're going. I haven't been lost in years. That's pretty
                            good.</p>
                        <p>What's happening to the Earth, what's happening to our oceans as we take the pulse of our
                            planet and consider other worlds beyond as we explore those.</p>
                        <p>So as we get ready to go back to the Moon with women and men and explore other worlds, the
                            roundness of our solar system and our universe is a special thing. And we should embrace
                            that as we understand why our planet isn't flat.</p>
